# kinect-visualiser

## Equipment
- 2 x Xbox 360 Kinect ( Model 1414 )
- 1 x Novation Launchpad S

## Notes
This code is given as is.
You may have to tweak the code if you want to use a different controller.
I was using SPOUT to send video signal to Resolume.
SPOUT is only works on Windows. You'll need to replace it with Syphon on Mac OS.

I don't intend on maintaining this repo.
